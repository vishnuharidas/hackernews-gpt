# HackerNews-GPT

This is built to experiment and explore the code generation capabilities of ChatGPT4.

The [website](https://hackernews-gpt.web.app/) is 100% generated by ChatGPT4 based on my prompts. I don't have much experience with ReactJS. ChatGPT4 directed me on how to build the app, which files to use, and even how to mix the Firebase Hosting files and ReactJS files so that I don't have to copy the `build/` folder over to the Firebase folder every time.

The key is to prompt correctly.
